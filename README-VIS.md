# Summary
We'll go through some basic principles about making web UI's with Google Polymer components. How data binding works and how we can make charts updating in real time from server data. We'll also check Jade and Less usage.

# Instructions
Run first `bower install` which will load some Google components that can be used. Check the charts code from `public` and `components` folders. Start node server and navigate to `http://localhost/charts` which holds the boilerplate code for our session.
